# Results Directory

This directory contains all analysis outputs generated by the spatial transcriptomics pipeline.

## Output Types

The analysis generates various types of outputs:

### Plots and Visualizations
- Spatial feature plots
- Quality control plots
- UMAP/PCA dimensionality reduction plots
- Cluster visualization maps
- Spatially variable gene plots
- Cell type annotation maps

### Data Tables
- Differential expression results
- Cluster marker genes
- Spatially variable gene lists
- Cell type assignments
- Quality metrics

### File Formats
- `.png`, `.jpg` - Static plot images
- `.pdf` - High-resolution publication-quality plots
- `.csv` - Tabular data exports
- `.rds` - R object saves for intermediate results

## Organization

Results are typically organized by analysis section:
- Quality control outputs
- Preprocessing results
- Clustering results
- Differential expression results
- Spatial analysis outputs
- Cell type annotation results

## Notes

- Results directory is created automatically when running the analysis
- The `.gitignore` file excludes most result files from version control
- Consider keeping a few example outputs for documentation purposes
- Large result files should be archived separately if needed for publication
