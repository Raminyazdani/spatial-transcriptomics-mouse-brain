Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(norm): Identify spatially variable features

Identified genes with highest spatial variability for downstream analysis. Variable features capture biological signal while filtering noise.

SCTransform automatically identifies ~3000 variable features based on expression variability across spots.

These features are used for:
- PCA computation
- Clustering  
- Differential expression

Timeline: Day 11 - 1 hour analyzing variable features.

Verification: Checked that variable features include known spatial markers.
