Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(markers): Extract and rank top marker genes

Processed FindAllMarkers results to extract top marker genes per cluster. Filtered and ranked by statistical significance and fold change.

Created tables of:
- Top 10 markers per cluster
- Marker expression patterns
- Statistical metrics (p-values, fold changes)

Timeline: Day 16 - 1 hour processing marker results.

Verification: Spot-checked top markers against literature.
