Interpreted differential expression results to assign preliminary biological identities to clusters based on marker expression.

Annotations:
- Clusters with Thy1, Snap25 → Excitatory neurons
- Clusters with Gad1, Gad2 → Inhibitory neurons
- Clusters with Mbp → Oligodendrocytes
- Clusters with Aldh1l1 → Astrocytes

Timeline: Day 17 - 2 hours interpreting markers.

Verification: Cross-referenced with literature, confirmed biological plausibility.
