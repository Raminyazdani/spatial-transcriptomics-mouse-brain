Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(dim-reduction): Add UMAP projection

Implemented UMAP for non-linear dimensionality reduction from 30 PCs to 2D. UMAP preserves local and global structure for visualization.

Used top 30 PCs as input based on elbow plot analysis. UMAP reveals cell type neighborhoods and biological gradients.

Timeline: Day 13 - 2 hours implementing UMAP.

Verification: Confirmed UMAP clusters correspond to spatial regions.
