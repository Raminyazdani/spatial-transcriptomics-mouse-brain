Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(portability): Implement cross-platform path handling

Refactored all path handling to be OS-agnostic. Removed hardcoded paths, added environment variable support.

Changes:
- PROJECT_DIR environment variable
- Automatic script location detection
- file.path() for all path construction
- No setwd() calls

Works on Windows, macOS, Linux without modification.

Timeline: Day 19-20 - 2 hours refactoring paths.

Verification: Tested on Windows and Linux.
