Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(dim-reduction): Create PCA diagnostic visualizations

Created comprehensive PCA diagnostic plots including elbow plots, loadings heatmaps, and spatial PC projections.

Visualizations help determine:
- How many PCs to retain
- Which genes drive each PC
- Spatial patterns in principal components

Identified optimal dimensionality: 30 PCs (based on elbow plot).

Timeline: Day 12-13 - 2 hours creating diagnostic visualizations.

Verification: Confirmed spatial patterns in top PCs align with brain anatomy.
