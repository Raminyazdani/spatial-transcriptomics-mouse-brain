Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | fix(norm): Increase future.globals.maxSize for multi-section processing (HOTFIX #3)

Fixed the future package memory limit error by increasing future.globals.maxSize. This allows processing multiple spatial sections simultaneously.

Configuration added:
```r
# Increase future globals size for spatial transcriptomics
# Needed when processing multiple sections with large spatial data
options(future.globals.maxSize = 20000 * 1024^2)  # 20 GB
```

Why this fixes the issue:
- Allows exporting large objects to parallel workers
- Spatial data includes expression matrices, coordinates, and images
- Multiple sections compound the size requirements
- 20 GB accommodates typical multi-section spatial experiments

This is a standard configuration for spatial transcriptomics workflows processing multiple samples.

After fix:
- SCTransform completes on all sections
- No memory export errors
- Parallel processing works correctly

Timeline: Day 10-11 - 30 minutes identifying and applying fix.

Verification: Processed both sections successfully, confirmed normalized SCT assay created for all samples.
