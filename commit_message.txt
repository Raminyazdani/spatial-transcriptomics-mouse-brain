Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(setup): Initial repository structure and README

Created initial repository with basic README, .gitignore, and directory structure. Set up project identity and goals. This is the foundation for all future work.

Starting with proper structure (directories, .gitignore) prevents future headaches with committed data files or results. The .gitignore includes R-specific patterns for .RData, .Rhistory, renv/library/, data/, and results/ directories.

Included:
- Basic project description with overview and planned structure
- R-specific ignore patterns
- Data and results directory placeholders with README files

Timeline: Day 1 - 30 minutes of initial setup.

Verification: Repository structure validated, .gitignore tested with sample R session.
