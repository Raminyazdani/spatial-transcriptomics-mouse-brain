Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | WIP(norm): Encounter memory limit error (OOPS #3)

Attempted to run SCTransform on full spatial dataset but hit R's default 500 MB future.globals.maxSize limit. This is a new issue discovered when processing the complete multi-section dataset.

Error message:
```
Error: The total size of the X globals that need to be exported exceeds 500.00 MiB
```

Root cause:
- Processing multiple tissue sections simultaneously
- Combined data size exceeds default R memory limits
- Future package's parallel processing hits export size limit
- Spatial data (expression + coordinates + images) is memory-intensive

This is different from the earlier memory issue (step 12-13) which was about general memory allocation. This specifically affects the future package's ability to export data to parallel workers.

Symptoms:
- Works on single sections
- Fails when processing both sections together
- Error during SCTransform parallel computations

Timeline: Day 10 - 1 hour debugging error.

Will need to adjust future package configuration in next step.
