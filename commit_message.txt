Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(markers): Create spatial feature plots for key markers

Created spatial feature plots showing marker expression overlaid on tissue images. Reveals spatial distribution patterns of cell type markers.

Plotted key markers:
- Thy1 (neurons)
- Gad1 (inhibitory neurons)
- Mbp (oligodendrocytes)
- Aldh1l1 (astrocytes)

Timeline: Day 16-17 - 2 hours creating spatial feature plots.

Verification: Confirmed marker spatial patterns match expected brain anatomy.
