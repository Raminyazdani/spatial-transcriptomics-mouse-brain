Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | fix(data): Correct data paths and add validation checks

Fixed the data path bug from previous commit. After attempting to run the script, got "cannot open connection" error and realized the paths don't match the actual extracted data structure.

Corrected paths in analysis.R:
- Changed from data/project_3/ to data/scbi_p3/project_3_dataset/
- Now matches the actual structure after extracting the 10X Visium dataset archive
- Added file existence checks before attempting to load data
- Improved error messages to help diagnose path issues

The corrected structure:
```
data/scbi_p3/project_3_dataset/
├── section_1/
│   ├── section_1_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5
│   ├── spatial/
│   │   ├── tissue_positions.csv
│   │   └── tissue_lowres_image.png
└── section_2/
    └── (similar structure)
```

Also added validation:
- Check if data directory exists before Load10X_Spatial
- Provide helpful error message with data acquisition instructions
- Prevents cryptic Seurat errors

Timeline: Day 3 - 1 hour to debug, identify issue, and implement fix with validation.

Verification: Tested with actual downloaded dataset structure, confirmed Load10X_Spatial succeeds.
