Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(dim-reduction): Implement PCA dimensionality reduction

Implemented Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality from ~3000 variable genes to 50 principal components.

Computed 50 PCs capturing major axes of variation in gene expression. Created elbow plot to determine optimal number of PCs to retain (typically 20-30).

Timeline: Day 12 - 2 hours implementing PCA and diagnostics.

Verification: Examined PC loadings for biological coherence.
