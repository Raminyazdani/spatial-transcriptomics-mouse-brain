Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(annotation): Assign cell types to clusters

Assigned final cell type annotations to clusters based on module scores and marker expression patterns.

Each cluster assigned primary cell type identity based on highest enrichment scores and spatial coherence.

Created annotated visualizations showing cell type distribution across tissue.

Timeline: Day 19 - 3 hours finalizing annotations.

Verification: Validated annotations against brain atlas, confirmed spatial coherence.
