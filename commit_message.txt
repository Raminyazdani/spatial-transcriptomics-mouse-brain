Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(qc): Calculate quality control metrics

Implemented comprehensive QC metrics calculation including mitochondrial, ribosomal, and hemoglobin percentages.

Calculated metrics:
- nCount_Spatial (UMI counts)
- nFeature_Spatial (gene counts)  
- percent.mt (mitochondrial genes)
- percent.ribo (ribosomal genes)
- percent.hb (hemoglobin genes)

These metrics identify tissue quality issues and technical artifacts.

Timeline: Day 7 - 2 hours implementing metric calculations.

Verification: Checked metric distributions match expected biological ranges.
