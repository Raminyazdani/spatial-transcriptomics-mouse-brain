Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | WIP(data): Add data loading and configuration framework

Implemented the foundation for loading 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics data. Added configuration handling for project paths and data sources. Started with basic Load10X_Spatial calls for both mouse brain sections.

Created main analysis.R script with:
- Configuration section with PROJECT_DIR environment variable support for flexible path handling
- Package loading statements for all required libraries
- Data directory setup and validation
- Basic Load10X_Spatial implementation for Section 1 and Section 2
- Initial Seurat object creation with spatial metadata

The configuration uses environment variable detection with fallback to getwd(), allowing the script to work in different environments (local dev, CI/CD, different operating systems).

Data loading logic calls Seurat's Load10X_Spatial which reads:
- Gene expression matrix (.h5 format)
- Spatial coordinates (tissue_positions.csv)
- Tissue images (tissue_lowres_image.png)

Timeline: Day 2-3 - 3 hours of implementation and testing with sample data structure.

Verification: Tested path detection logic, validated Load10X_Spatial parameters against 10X Visium documentation.
