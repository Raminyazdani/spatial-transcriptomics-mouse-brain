Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(clustering): Create spatial cluster visualizations

Created comprehensive visualizations of clustering results overlaid on tissue images. Shows clear correspondence between clusters and brain anatomy.

Visualizations include:
- SpatialDimPlot with clusters on tissue
- UMAP colored by cluster
- Cluster size distributions
- Spatial coherence assessment

Timeline: Day 15 - 2 hours creating cluster visualizations.

Verification: Validated spatial coherence, compared to mouse brain atlas.
