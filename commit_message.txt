Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(qc): Apply quality filtering to remove low-quality spots

Applied quality control filters based on QC metric distributions to remove low-quality spots and outliers.

Filtering thresholds applied:
- min_features: 200 genes
- max_features: 6000 genes
- max_mt_percent: 20%
- min_counts: 500 UMI
- max_counts: 30000 UMI

Filtered out spots with:
- Too few genes (likely empty or failed spots)
- Too many genes (potential doublets)
- High mitochondrial content (dying cells)
- Extreme count outliers

Logged before/after statistics showing filtering impact.

Timeline: Day 9 - 2 hours determining thresholds and applying filters.

Verification: Confirmed filtered spots were spatial outliers or edge artifacts.
