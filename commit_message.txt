Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | WIP(data): Fix data loading for both sections

Attempted to standardize data paths for consistency across sections. Changed data directory structure to use simpler paths, but accidentally introduced a bug in the process.

Modified analysis.R with updated data paths:
- Changed to data/project_3/section1 and data/project_3/section2
- Intended to simplify path structure
- This will break when actual data is downloaded (should be data/scbi_p3/project_3_dataset/)

This is a realistic mistake that happens during iterative development - the paths work conceptually but don't match the actual structure of the downloaded 10X Visium dataset archive. The error won't be apparent until attempting to run the script with real data.

The bug manifests as: "Error in Load10X_Spatial: cannot open connection" because the directory structure doesn't exist after data extraction.

Timeline: Day 3 - 30 minutes of path refactoring without testing against actual data structure.

This will be fixed in the next commit after discovering the issue during first run attempt.
