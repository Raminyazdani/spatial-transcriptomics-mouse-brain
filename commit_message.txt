Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(analysis): Examine slide properties and spot characteristics

Analyzed basic properties of the Visium slides including spot counts, spatial dimensions, and tissue coverage patterns.

Examined:
- Total number of spots per section
- Spatial coordinate ranges
- Percentage of spots overlapping tissue
- Image resolution and scaling factors
- Spot spacing and tissue area coverage

Key findings inform:
- Expected data size for memory allocation
- Spatial resolution for visualization
- Coverage uniformity across sections

Timeline: Day 5 - 1 hour examining slide metadata.

Verification: Compared spot counts and dimensions against 10X Visium specifications.
