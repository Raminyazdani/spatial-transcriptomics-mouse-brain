Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(qc): Create QC visualizations

Generated comprehensive visualizations of QC metrics including violin plots, spatial feature plots, and distribution histograms.

Visualizations reveal:
- Spatial patterns in quality metrics
- Correlation between metrics
- Areas with potential issues
- Overall data quality assessment

Created multi-panel summary plots saved to results/ directory.

Timeline: Day 8 - 3 hours creating visualizations.

Verification: Inspected plots for biological plausibility and spatial coherence.
