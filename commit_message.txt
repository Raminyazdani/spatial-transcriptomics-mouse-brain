Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(deps): Add renv for reproducible environment management

Initialized renv to manage R package dependencies. This ensures reproducibility across different systems and over time. After exploring various packages needed (Seurat, dplyr, ggplot2, etc.), captured the environment in renv.lock.

Key packages captured:
- Seurat (v5.0+) for spatial transcriptomics analysis
- dplyr for data manipulation  
- ggplot2 and patchwork for visualization
- SpatialExperiment for spatial data structures
- CellChat and SCDC for cell type analysis
- hdf5r for reading 10X HDF5 files

Setting up dependency management early prevents "works on my machine" problems and makes the project reproducible months or years later. The renv.lock file captures exact package versions including all transitive dependencies.

Timeline: Day 1-2 (after package exploration) - 2 hours including testing various spatial transcriptomics packages.

Verification: Tested renv::restore() on clean R environment to ensure reproducibility.
