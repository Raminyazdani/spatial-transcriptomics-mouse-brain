Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(clustering): Implement Louvain clustering

Implemented graph-based clustering using Louvain algorithm to identify distinct spatial domains. Tested multiple resolutions (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2).

Selected resolution 0.8 as optimal balance between granularity and interpretability. Clusters show spatial coherence and correspond to anatomical brain regions.

Timeline: Day 14-15 - 3 hours testing resolutions and evaluating clusters.

Verification: Confirmed clusters are spatially contiguous and anatomically meaningful.
