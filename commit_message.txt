Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(markers): Calculate differential expression for all clusters

Implemented differential expression analysis using FindAllMarkers to identify marker genes for each spatial cluster.

Parameters:
- only.pos = TRUE (upregulated markers)
- min.pct = 0.25 (expressed in 25% of spots)
- logfc.threshold = 0.25

Generates ranked marker lists for each cluster enabling biological interpretation.

Timeline: Day 15-16 - 2 hours running differential expression.

Verification: Checked that top markers have biological relevance.
