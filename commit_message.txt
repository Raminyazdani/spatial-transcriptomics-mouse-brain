Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(annotation): Calculate cell type enrichment scores

Calculated module scores for each cell type using CellMarker reference markers. Enrichment scores indicate likelihood of each cell type per spot.

Used AddModuleScore to compute enrichment for:
- Excitatory neurons
- Inhibitory neurons
- Astrocytes
- Oligodendrocytes
- Microglia

Timeline: Day 18-19 - 2 hours calculating scores.

Verification: Checked score distributions are biologically plausible.
