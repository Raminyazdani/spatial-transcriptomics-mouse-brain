Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(markers): Create marker gene heatmaps

Generated heatmaps showing expression patterns of top marker genes across all clusters. Heatmaps reveal cluster-specific expression signatures.

Visualizations include:
- DoHeatmap of top markers
- Expression scaled by cluster
- Hierarchical clustering of genes and spots

Timeline: Day 16 - 2 hours creating heatmaps.

Verification: Confirmed markers show cluster-specific enrichment.
