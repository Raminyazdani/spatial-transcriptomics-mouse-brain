Ramin Yazdani | spatial-transcriptomics-mouse-brain | main | feat(clustering): Build k-nearest neighbor graph

Built k-nearest neighbor graph in PCA space as foundation for clustering. Used 30 PCs for graph construction.

The KNN graph connects each spot to its most similar neighbors based on gene expression patterns. This graph structure enables community detection algorithms.

Timeline: Day 14 - 1 hour building neighbor graph.

Verification: Checked graph statistics (degree distribution, connectivity).
