Ramin_Atiya_project_script.R → analysis.R	filename rename	Ramin_Atiya_project_script.R	analysis.R	Removed author names from filename to eliminate assignment artifact and make filename descriptive of function
analysis.R	lines 1-34	"# ==========================================\n# Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis: Mouse Brain\n# ==========================================\n# Authors:\n# Ramin Yazdani\n# Matriculation number: 7068679..."	"# ==========================================\n# Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis: Mouse Brain\n# ==========================================\n#\n# Analysis of 10X Visium spatial transcriptomics data from mouse brain tissue..."	Removed all assignment metadata: student names, matriculation numbers, student emails, course info, instructors, assistants, lab names, project number, deadline
analysis.R	lines 20-32 (new)	'project_dir = "D:/scb3"\ncurrent_dir = getwd()\nif (current_dir != project_dir) {\n  setwd(project_dir)\n}'	'if (Sys.getenv("PROJECT_DIR") != "") {\n  project_dir <- Sys.getenv("PROJECT_DIR")\n} else {\n  project_dir <- tryCatch({\n    dirname(sys.frame(1)$ofile)\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    getwd()\n  })\n}'	Replaced absolute Windows path with portable relative path detection that works on all OS; removed setwd() usage; added environment variable override option
analysis.R	lines 75-167 (new)	'user_input <- readline(prompt = "Do you want to download the file automatically (yes/no/quit)? ")\n...\nresponse <- readLines(n = 1)'	'auto_download <- tolower(Sys.getenv("AUTO_DOWNLOAD", "no"))\ninteractive_mode <- interactive() && auto_download != "yes"\n...\ndownload_with_prompt() function'	Refactored interactive prompts into configurable function supporting AUTO_DOWNLOAD environment variable for non-interactive execution
analysis.R	throughout	"################### Week 1 ##################################################################################\n##################  1 Spatial Transcriptomics (Bonus: 5P)"	"# ==========================================\n# Analysis Section 1: Spatial Transcriptomics Data Exploration\n# =========================================="	Replaced all "Week 1/2", point values, and numbered section headers with descriptive professional section headers
.gitignore	new file	N/A	Created .gitignore with R-specific patterns	Created comprehensive .gitignore to prevent committing data files, results, temporary files, and R artifacts
